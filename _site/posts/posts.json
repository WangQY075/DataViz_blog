The graph trying to compare merchandise trade data of top six trading countries from 2009 to 2020. However, the original title stays on the description of the data and does not drive the messages of the major observation of the graph and does not have sub-title to explain the key words.\r\nX-axis is unclear. The title of this graph said, “Merchandise Trade of Top Six Countries, 2009-2020”. But we can observe that the X-axis still have the data from 2021. Besides X axis label use” Month of period” but there are no tick marks or label show the months.\r\nThe unit of Y-axis is not uniform. Some country uses million and some uses thousand make it hard to do comparison.\r\nThe Area chart is used, which is meaningless because the shaded area does not have means. Besides putting import and export in the same chart make is hard to identify the trends.\r\n1.2 Aesthetic\r\nTick marks not been used for both X and Y-axis.\r\nPut six countries one as an individual part is a good design to show the comparison and the part of each country is too small to intent more detail. And Repeated labels for each country is unnecessary.\r\nThe font of the title is smaller than the font of the label.\r\n2.0 Alternative Design\r\n\r\n2.1 Clarity\r\nAdd explanation to the main findings. Adjust Y-axis unit of data to million dollars and separate import and export to two different charts make it easier to compare the trend.\r\nUse Month to separate the charts inside of countries. Enable the reader to compare the trend between different countries in the same period of 2019 and 2020 and identify the overall rank.\r\nAdd tooltip to show the percentage of change and annotate let reader identify the key findings.\r\n2.2 Aesthetic\r\nAdd tick marks to Y-axis.\r\nUse color highlight the main countries want to show to the readers and to show the increase and decrease percentage.\r\n3.0 Proposed Visualisation\r\nPlease view the visualisation on Tableau Public here\r\n3.1 Data Preparation\r\nFirst select the data we used from data source. The original number unit of America import and export data are million dollars. Converting it into thousand dollars by using “Paste Special-operation-multiply”.\r\n\r\nThen, reformat data we used into time series format and rename countries and adjust data retention to integer.\r\n\r\n3.2 Data Visualization\r\nImport into Tableau\r\n\r\n\r\n2.Change data type. Change ‘Time’ data type from string to Date.\r\n\r\nCreate line chart Drag [Time] and [Import] to Columns and Rows respectively. Click “+” mark on [Time] and add MONTH to Columns. Then adjust the order of YEAR and MONTH For export line chart, drag [Export] to Rows. \r\nApply colour Drag [Country] to colour, adjusting colours and choose brighter to highlight America, Mainland China, Malaysia and Taiwan.\r\n\r\nUpdate view Update view from ‘Standard’ to ‘Entire View’.\r\nReformat MONTH and YEAR labels Click the triangle behand MONTH, choose Format. Update Date from Automatic to Abbreviation. Update YEAR to two-digital through same method.\r\n\r\nUpdate Tooltip First create increase and decrease fields through: Analysis-Create Calculated Field and the code shows below:\r\n\r\nAdjust data to percentage format with one decimal places.\r\n\r\n\r\n8.Create Dashboard\r\nAdd Title: “Merchandise Import and Export Trends of Six Top Countries，2019-2020”\r\nAdd Explanation: “In general, American and Mainland China are two main market for both import and export in 2019 and 2020.For import,compared with the same period in 2019, American shows a overall decrease trend while Taiwan has an increase trend.And for export, a clear decrease trend showed in Malaysia with highest -42.1% decrease.”\r\nAdd sheets “IMPORT” and “EXPORT” to Dashboard.\r\nAdjust Size to “Automatic”.\r\nAdd Data Source at the bottle of the Dashboard.\r\nThe final graph shows below:\r\n\r\n5.0 Derived Insights\r\nIn general, American and Mainland China are two main market for both import and export in 2019 and 2020. Taiwan ranks higher as an import market instead of export and Hong Kong, on the contrary, more important as an export market.\r\nFor import, compared with the same period in 2019, American shows a overall decrease trend with maximum -32.6% drop in Aug. While import form Taiwan shows an overall increasing trend.\r\nFor export, a clear decrease trend showed in Malaysia with highest -42.1% decrease. Merchandise export to Mainland China is concentrated in Aug-Dec of 2019 and 2020. Compared with 2019, 2020 export more to Mainland China in the second half of the year with highest increase 23.1% in Oct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
