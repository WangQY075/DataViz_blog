# 1.0 Critique of Visualization

The original visualization can be seen below:

![](img/original graph.jpg)

## 1.1 Clarity
* The title of the graph does not convey the intent of the graph. The graph trying to compare merchandise trade data of top six trading countries from 2009 to 2020. However, the original title stays on the description of the data and does not drive the messages of the major observation of the graph and does not have sub-title to explain the key words.

* X-axis is unclear. The title of this graph said, “Merchandise Trade of Top Six Countries, 2009-2020”. But we can observe that the X-axis still have the data from 2021. Besides X axis label use” Month of period” but there are no tick marks or label show the months.

* The unit of Y-axis is not uniform. Some country uses million and some uses thousand make it hard to do comparison.

* The Area chart is used, which is meaningless because the shaded area does not have means. Besides putting import and export in the same chart make is hard to identify the trends.

## 1.2 Aesthetic

* Tick marks not been used for both X and Y-axis.

* Put six countries one as an individual part is a good design to show the comparison and the part of each country is too small to intent more detail. And Repeated labels for each country is unnecessary.

* The font of the title is smaller than the font of the label.

# 2.0 Alternative Design 

![](img/Draft.jpg)

## 2.1 Clarity

*  Add explanation to the main findings. Adjust Y-axis unit of data to million dollars and separate import and export to two different charts make it easier to compare the trend.

*  Use Month to separate the charts inside of countries. Enable the reader to compare the trend between different countries in the same period of 2019 and 2020 and identify the overall rank.

* Add tooltip to show the percentage of change and annotate let reader identify the key findings.


## 2.2 Aesthetic

*  Add tick marks to Y-axis.

* Use color highlight the main countries want to show to the readers and to show the increase and decrease percentage. 


# 3.0 Proposed Visualisation
